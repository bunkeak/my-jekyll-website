## Less is more in December

I have to be honest with you, this might have been the trickiest goals of all, doing less in the season before Christmas. I really tried fitting most of it in November, not all can be done that much in advance. We had circumstances that made us slow down, the little one got ill beginning of December. That usually gives a break although this time we were doing homeschooling, for us a first. Mid of December we had really winter weather, enjoyed the ride to school and Hort with a slide for almost a week.

That was quite useful as exercising and limited also our circle how far we could go with the slide and a child on it. Also this year we decided to buy an aquarium to enable observations of a small biotope in our appartement. The screenshot shows the arrival of fishes in the aquarium after Christmas.

Although the snow was gone at Christmas and we had rather mild temperatures, it helped a lot getting into Christmas spirit this year. Feeling too cold to stay long on a Christmas market and hurry home after having tried out quite some specialities and bought some last minute gifts (very practical). It has been a while.

Will announce in the beginning of the year what the focus will be next year, maybe not every month but rather when I have something to report, can be every three months, can be more often. Will see. Until then, let there be light!
