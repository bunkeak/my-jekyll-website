Making decisions what really is needed and where we can instead save money is a relatively new concept to us. So for the easter holidays and to celebrate the belated birthday of my mom was a good occasion for us to visit my hometown.

Saving money is another quite big change for us. That might also mean less travelling or at least travelling in a different way to save costs. We order less from outside and not only save costs but do something good for the environment by preparing similar dishes ourselfs. One of the last views of the dining place in the old flat is shown in the third image.

The biggest change for us that needs preparation is moving. Not far, just a different setting, more in the city centre and less where green and industrial areas are around. We will need a new kitchen for this one, so here you see a pretty unspectacular view where the kitchen will come.

We are in the middle of sorting, packing boxes and look really forward to this relatively big change.
