It's that time of the year again. When summer is really over, the leaves start falling and things keep changing. Not the best time for persons fearing change, luckily I am not one of them.

I was hoping for that mood in November, I do that almost the entire year and on a walk it just looked stunning. This for me is perfect.

We did travels, too. I bought a ticket for a month for the little one and we had a little adventure to ourselfs travelling with a lot of persons at the end of the week. It was fun, it was long and we did the last part by car with my better half.

We rediscovered the botanical garden in Munich and spent quite some time admiring flora and fauna from diverse regions of the earth in greenhouses.

Last day of the year was planned some time to relax and enjoy, the little one however had other plans. I wanted to swim, she wanted to test out something more exciting. I was worried, I admit it, especially as going there just the two of us meant I had to play along.

She tried a lot, the climbing, the trampolines and much more. The part you see on the image looks great, but was not her favorite, she enjoyed much more the trampoline area.

I am very proud of her that she challenges herself, must be typical for young persons, they try out so many things that we might have already stopped. For 2026, new challenge ahead. More about that latest end of February.
