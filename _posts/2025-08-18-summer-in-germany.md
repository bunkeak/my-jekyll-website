This year we spent vacations in Germany and only did smaller trips. First one was for a round birthday for my better half to Legoland. First image is from Atlantis where everyone could feel surrounded by fish and water.

Second trip was to the birthday of one of my brothers. We went to celebrate in Potsdam and in a small park the second image was taken. We did not walk much but rather relaxed in the not so hot surrounding.
