After a very warm May, June is even warmer. Summer is coming very early this year. With this kind of weather, we preferred spending time outside close to the water.

Small rivers are nice, although here the spot is very popular for dog walks, too. The next image shows a playground in the city nearby, water, a lot of fun in the sun and very green. We go frequently there, too. The idea is to start early or wait for after dinner in case the sun is very strong, not only is it more pleasant, but less people as nice side-effect, too.

The last impression is in another region of Germany. Close to a cave, the area was very fresh and pleasant. It is not allowed to enter the cave itself so we just advanced a bit on the wet stones. The limit what is allowed is the water itself, it is not allowed to dive in the water to enter the cave that must be quite big.

Today, the weather got a bit milder again which is very nice. I will try making it a habit to keep spending time outside by bike, on rollerskates and other sports equipment.
