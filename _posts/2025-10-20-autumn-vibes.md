Autumn is here and with it my preferred season in the year. A bit early for the season we did visit a café that is already in the spirit.

It might seem odd but when the bad weather is back here, I tend to organize bit by bit the end of the year, what is still needed, when the tires needs to get changed. It helps me cope at the end of the year much better. So far the theory.

This year however, we tend to live in the moment as things do not happen as planned and we cannot plan that much in advance. The second image is a good october weather with colourful leaves.

On the third image is what the little one recently did. After a round with the scooter she cleaned in the city center the leaves out of a fountain. I was so proud of her.

The last image from the last two months is a great shot from my new office. We got lucky and saw a double rainbow indicating the end of the month would be good. It turned out it did. After a busy last week in october we had a really nice walk in the small town and met a lot of nice persons giving us presents.
