What a start to the New Year 2026! We had real winter, also kind of a hint of summer recently and new inspirations, too.

We are grateful for the region we are living in and enjoying it at every weather, snow, rain and what they call here emperor weather. That was a beautiful day for a walk.

The new inspiration in terms of art are two new art studios in our city. A small town that starting from tomorrow has even two places to paint your personal dishes, bowls and much more.

Only one of the very beautiful occasions to enjoy the weather. I personally enjoy being near the river a lot recently.

But to finally come to the challenge of the year, we want to make a habit of change, change of the seasons, change of position for my better half, change of school for the little one. Let's get started.
