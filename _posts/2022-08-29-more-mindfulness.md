Mindfulness has been a project of mine for quite a while already. I thought it would be easy to integrate and advance on this during holidays. Although that was the case, you can always do more. I did not practise meditations that take longer. I advanced for sure to be present in the moment and could turn the autopilot off quite frequently.
