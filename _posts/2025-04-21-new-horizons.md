End of march I finished my last position I had for almost 8 years. It was a challenging time also looking forward for the new position. The first image shows only one gesture I got from the lovely colleagues I enjoyed having for many years. I hope they know how much they mean to me. I was really overwhelmed with the diverse talks, attentions and messages I got.

At the end of March we had the chance of enjoying an artifical salt grotto in the Brandenburg region. This is shown in the next image. It was a family reunion at the occasion of the round birthday of my mum. We enjoyed it very much and want to do that more frequently in our region.

The new position has started very well, I like the new colleagues and challenges a lot. After busy first weeks, easter came along and we matched the experience with the salt grotto with a natural cave in Germany. First time for the little one, finally she is old enough to discover those lovely places with us.

A really wonderful idea of the area is making kids discover as many natural caves as possible and they will receive surprises, this generally works very well and will keep us busy the following months.
