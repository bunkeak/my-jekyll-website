It is already July. Here comes the recap of the last two months. In may, there was a challenge in the new company to collect points for walking, physical activity in general but also meditating, learning new things and cooking. In this context, although I do not have a bike anymore, I leased a bike for the weekend and combined rides in family and alone.

This was mainly the starting point, not too exhausting and the goal was the playground in the city nearby. Very empty and calm at that time still. We had snacks and spend quite a while on that playground, kind of a tradition by now.

Still on that challenge, we went to a caf√© of berries, where a playground and various options for collecting fruits and vegetables are present. It was childrens day so the little one was carried back to pay for the collected berries.

And then sort of a little Oktoberfest in our town started, we went as family and enjoyed the pretty small ferrous wheel together. The little one got lucky with drawing lots and it was a wonderful day.

Last but not least, as it is July already I wanted to share a picture from what we did yesterday. We went as two families to a guided canoe and kayak tour. On the way to the island in the middle of the lake we were together in a kayak, the way back was two persons canoe for us, we got lucky.

We try to carefully select what we do and keep sufficient downtime to relax in between. Next newsletter will come at the end of august with some summer news from our side.
