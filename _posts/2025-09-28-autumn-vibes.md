Autumn is here and with it my preferred season in the year. A bit early for the season we did visit a caf√© that is already in the spirit.

It might seem odd but when the bad weather is back here, I tend to organize bit by bit the end of the year, what is still needed, when the tires needs to get changed. It helps me cope at the end of the year much better.
