Mindfulness has been a project of mine for quite a while already. I thought it would be easy to integrate and advance on this during holidays. Although that was the case, you can always do more. I did not practise a lot of meditations that take longer. I advanced for sure to be present in the moment and could turn the autopilot off quite frequently.

We had this view almost every day during holidays, the orange tent is ours. I am convinced being in nature helps a lot to be mindful.

This is the little one in the cornfield. We found all clues and managed to get out of it quite rapidly. She was completely in the moment, it was nice to see that.

Highlight of the vacations was the Ozeaneum at Stralsund. She could contemplate the aquaria for almost half an hour each! Just imagining little stories with the fish. She was convinced to have found new friends and does not eat fish for a while now. It makes her even very sad seeing dead fish presented to buy.

Last but not least, I had my first talk in the company on mindfulness recently and got some pretty positive feedback from it. I was very nervous talking about my emotions and how I deal with them in front of colleagues. It appears it all went fine. Next week another talk, other language, same topic. To be continued.
