## More Exercising in September

Where to start? We have a long way to convince everyone at home that frequent exercising is useful. We started the month looking at Basketball EM and playing at the same time. That was fun.

We continued and used the nice weather doing bicycle rounds in the area. To playgrounds (more exercising), small rivers and also to service for e-bike during not so nice weather.

Since the mid of the month I get to walk a lot. We do not want to be parents driving the kid to school in a big SUV. So we mainly walk. Weather does not bother us that much until now. We appreciate the change of the season and hopefully get fit someday. Until then, I do get a lot of fresh air, I am not so often sick and I am sleeping better. For a start, this is not bad.

End of the month, my VHS course of Tai Chi restarted. I missed my group of people and really appreciate the restart. Next goal would be to keep the frequency and continue exercising.
