## More Exercising in September

It turns out this one was tricky. I still cannot do much intensive training, need to focus on walking a lot. I could do that more frequently since school started and we train the way to school, to Hort and sometimes back home walking with the little one.

Second thing I did was bringing e-bikes to service, that was quite some intense training. The weather in September is not always ideal for exercising outside. Just in time before the end of the month, I started my guided training in Tai Chi again.
