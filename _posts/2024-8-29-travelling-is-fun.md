July was rather relaxing as we planned a lot of travelling for August this year. We met family and for that we booked a so called IFA in a beautiful area in the beginning of vacation time. This is what is highlighted in the first image.

For real vacations, we went to France first, visited friends and then we went to the Baltic Sea. It was sort of a road trip first, and followed by relaxation time. Here is shown a day trip to Stralsund to the Ozeaneum, we did meet family there, too.

One thing we did almost every day was going to the beach. All the way back is the little one playing with water, my better half in the middle standing and looking at the Sea and me in the beach chair.

Although challenging we had a great time and enjoyed it everywhere we went. Back at home now we get ready for starting daily routines next week. Hope you had a great summer so far. Next blog post will follow end of October.
