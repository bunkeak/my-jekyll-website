This year we spent vacations in Germany and only did smaller trips. First one was for a round birthday for my better half to Legoland. First image is from Atlantis where everyone could feel surrounded by fish and water.

Second trip was to the birthday of one of my brothers. We went to celebrate in Potsdam and in a small park the second image was taken. We did not walk much but rather relaxed in the not so hot surrounding.

In August, we did trips to Switzerland and sort of a roadtrip to visit friends and family. First, we went to the so-called Dreil√§ndereck, so basically where Germany, Switzerland and France meet. On the swiss side, we went to a wildpark and watched animals in the heat.

On the roadtrip, it was fresher each day and we managed to visit the Botanical Garden we enjoy all of us in Jena. We also went to Braunschweig, to the National Car Museum, close to Koblenz and on the way back to the Swabian Alb.

I already am back working, there is a bit more time for my family to relax from the diverse trips we enjoyed this summer. I will give more news at the end of October. Hopefully calmer months are ahead of us.
