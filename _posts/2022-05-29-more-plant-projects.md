## More Plant Projects in May

This is the first post in this whole new project of mine to do blog posts. This month, the challenge was to do more plant projects. So far, I continued with wild strawberry, thyme, lemon balm and onion.

The idea is to give away most of it as I can't put all those plants on the balcony. It is very calming and indeed a very good balance to my IT tasks for work and to create this blog.

Some ideas do not work as I would like them to, but this helps me expect less in my daily-live, too. Are plants teaching me additional humbleness?
