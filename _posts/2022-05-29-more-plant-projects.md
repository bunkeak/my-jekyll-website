This is the first post in this whole new project of mine to do blog posts. This month, the challenge was to do more plant projects. I continued with wild strawberry, thyme, lemon balm and onion from a Primoza calendar inside the flat and on the balcony.

The idea is to give away most of it as I can't put all those plants on the balcony. It is very calming and indeed a very good balance to my IT tasks for work and to create this blog.

Some ideas do not work as I would like them to, but this helps me expect less in my daily-live, too. Are plants teaching me additional humbleness?

I try to learn much more on the different plants that surround us and I feel that I somehow respect the nature already much more. So many things to learn, wild herbs that might get used as spice. On top of that, I somehow want to throw seedbombs in places where clearly plants are not wanted. Just thinking about it.

And then I am so pleased when I see gardens or public space where people make so much effort, this one is close to a lake and a playground, an area that is designated for wild flowers and will not get cut.

I did buy seed confetti for the next big party on the playground. That also is a first time. Regional plants in the middle of the playground just because children want to have fun, sounds much better than leaving plastic in the nature or having to collect all the fun later on again.

In a similar objective, we did for the third time I think plant seeds using Pandacraft, a french crafting set. Really nice result, we added two additional small pots, as there are much more seeds and soil available. Afterwards we added water to the glasses, that makes it easy to actually get something as a result, as we do not need to think about it everyday.

Altogether, I feel more connected, more grounded and balanced with this experience. I like working with soil, taking care of little seedlings and see what has become of it. I guess we can need a little bit more grounding these days. Nice side effect, my balcony is getting much more attractive recently.
