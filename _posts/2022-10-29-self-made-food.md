This challenge we did together as a family. Food is important to all of us, each one approached the challenge from a different angle. First, we got a new grill. That way, finally we did more things on the grill and used this one even yesterday. That is more just like waffles my better half doing that.

The youngest one does like to make her own bread with interesting ingredients, it seems to be more of an experiment, later more about that.

First, I wanted to try out something new. However, the challenge is doing that more frequently, so I did standard bourgeois cooking matching the season. A lot of pumpinks, cake of onions and also chocolate cake. My own stollen, that is starting to be yearly tradition. I mix the plain recepies with french classics and did puff pastry filled with leek and a good cheese. For this, I needed egg yolk on top of it. I generally do prepare meringue with the egg white. It was delicious and quite perfect, however I left it open overnight. The end result is pure Chemistry, the crunch was gone and attracted back water in it, reminded me that cooking, especially baking, is really an art and science coming together.

That also explains why all of us like it that much. Yesterday we had pointed cabbage in a casserole with cream, potatoes and a bit of bacon as a side dish for the things from the grill. Guten Appetit everyone!

We will continue our journey in preparing more home-made food, I was thinking about traditional gingerbread from Nuremberg. That might be left for November, quite many of those things are prepared in advance to have an easier time around Christmas. Looking forward to that.
