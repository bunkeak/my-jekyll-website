September was a bit slower in activities so I had time for reading and thinking. Thankfulness is a big thing for a while now and I always wonder if we respect ourself completely if we focus on one specific part to make us happier. The idea is in the end, being more in the moment by realizing what you take for granted everyday. Being outside and exercising generally helps me be more in the moment.

I ride by bike more often since it is not so hot anymore. One of the images of my favorite lake nearby was taken in beginning of September. I practise frequently to see the positive instead of the bad, it is like a muscle that needs training often. The little one needs more exercises, we went again by bike and she could trampoline for free at a party for the people. A lot of associations presented what they do and there was a lot in it for kids.

What I did on the national holiday was to write down 100 things I was or am grateful for. In the beginning, I thought that might take a while, tried to list them chronologically. Turns out, I could easily list 100 things, persons, times I was or am still grateful for. Now the exercise was to find the central theme and it turns out, this is not evident for me. It looks like trying out new things is something I value a lot. If you are interested, the challenge was coming in a question on Friday from [Vertellis](https://vertellis.de/pages/freitag).
