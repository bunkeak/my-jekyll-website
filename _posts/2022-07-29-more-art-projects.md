This one was tricky. I do love art, art d√©co and the modern way of painting, my expectations are quite high and I just had the feeling it would not be good enough. However, the process of doing art does not necessarily mean a great result, the process of doing art sometimes is the goal.

So we jumped right into it and started with dough and collage. Dough in funny colors for the little one and collage for me.

I had this project in my head for a while. The basis already is important, it was 2010 the first half of the year, for me a lot of things changed during that time. I did similar collages at important occasions, I like that process very much. I search in magazines for nice looking pictures, words, collect postcards and pictures of the family. Altogether it should mean something to me, that is the important thing.

Later during the month I had the chance in trying out wax crayons and did opt for something very easy. I almost forgot how happy it made me to paint more frequently. This is something I should do more regularly if the result is an art piece and plus it makes me happy.
