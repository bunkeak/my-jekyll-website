I wished for more travelling and adventures and that is exactly what we did the last two months. Mid July I booked an Adventure camp at a lake with sleeping in a tent over the weekend. On the first evening, bread on a stick was prepared and a walk in the night with torches was done, too.

Difficult was the amount of sun and time on a lake. Beautiful scenery though. Altogether, canoe, kayak and building a raft was done at or on the lake. Was really good for the kid and I enjoyed it, too. Later on we travelled twice to Berlin, anniversary and first day at school were the main reasons.

Somehow I managed to find a hotel that really spoils us. In the city centre, with a pool and we travelled both times by train. The second stay at the hotel was even better than the first time, we had breakfast there, too.

The image was taken close to Potsdamer Platz, in the background Brandenburger Tor can be seen, me and my husband have been at that exact place having a look at the [light barrier that got lifted 25 years after the wall was opened](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wasik/15139696474/in/photostream/). This was 2014 and so many things did change. Really good souvenirs.

After all those adventures we are currently seeking some rest. I am looking forward and getting a first glimpse on autumn right now.
