November and December are usually quite busy months for us. A detail on a long-awaited trip is shown here, how the snow started in the morning and announced the beginning of a wonderful day.

Every year in the time before Christmas, we do some decorations, each year a bit different. This year, my better half decided on a bought advent crown with four candels, we decorated some little ginger bread houses and combined it with a table cloth and a pyramid made of wood.

Following the seasons also is embracing changes, it was pretty different visiting my hometown, much calmer somehow. At the end of the first Christmas Day, we took the chance and visited Moritzburg nearby, still quite busy but getting less and less crowded the more we walked around the castle.

It took a while to get this entry together, somehow the start of the new Year was a bit unusual and not so quiet anymore. We have several reasons to travel to Berlin at the beginning of 2025 so we will visit the area more frequently now. Stay tuned for next entry end of February.
