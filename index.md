## Why Man in the Mirror?

In terms of inspiration this - in my opinion - best song of Michael Jackson is a really good starting point in questioning yourself. No matter if you are a man, the change can only start within yourself.

This is why I called this blog that way.

## First Goal achieved

Bringing this website entirely by myself up and running is my first goal achieved. I will not lie, the template is what I use at work, it is a starting point I want to make fancy changes to myself in the upcoming months.

## Each Month a new challenge

At the end of each month, I will post a new entry about the goal I set myself up to.

## Challenge for 2023

In 2023 I want to focus on staying calm and relaxed. I will approach that goal with various strategies. The challenges will get more demanding, asking for additional skills in mindfulness, relaxation strategies. That may work well in some moments, less in others. Starting the change is the idea, I will not turn into a super relaxed person in just one year.

## Challenge for 2024

I realized I did not only find out how to stay relaxed last year but more and more I figured out what I need in order to stay relaxed. So what might be missing still. To go in that direction, I will need to go into the unknown, try out things that I like and quit those that do not feel good. Easier said than done.

## Challenge for 2025

Now that I know what I want and what I need, I advance in that direction. 2025 is the year of change, with conviction and no fear.
